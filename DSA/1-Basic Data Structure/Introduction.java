Introduction to Basic Data Structures in Java

*** Definition

- A data structure is a specialized way of organizing, storing, and managing data in a computer 
  so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.
- In simpler terms, data structures define how data is arranged in memory (RAM) 
  and how operations such as accessing, inserting, deleting, or updating data are performed.

*** Importance

- Data structures are important because they organize data efficiently, enabling fast access, 
  modification, and optimal use of memory in software systems.

*** Operations in Data Structures

- Insertion – Add an element.
- Deletion – Remove an element.
- Traversal – Visit all elements (e.g., for searching or printing).
- Searching – Find the location of a given element.
- Sorting – Arrange elements in a particular order.

*** Types of Data Structures
- Primitive Data Structures: Basic types like integers, floats, characters, and booleans.
- Non-Primitive Data Structures: More complex structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
